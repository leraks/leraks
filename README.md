### Hi there 👋 This is Ilya Spiridonov
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I am a student at the Novosibirsk State University of Economics and Management (nsuem). I have quite a lot of free time to do, for example, such things as designing my GitHub profile, if there is any criticism about my profile and my projects, say I will stand it






<!--

I can write code in different languages:<br /> <br />
print("Привет мир") <br />
print("Hello world") <br />
print("你好世界") <br />
print("توهان ان جو لفظي ترجمو ڪيو") <br />
print("Hola Mundo") <br />
